### Project Summary

This project explores (somewhat silly) questions using R, plotting, and statistical inference. 

### What this work demonstrates

Through this work I am able to demonstrate my ability to not only accomplsh data analysis, but my ability to communicate my thought process and findings. 

## [Research Paper about the Pix2Vox Method](https://github.com/codyharris91/Pix2Vox-B657-Experiments) [<sup>2</sup>](#Footnotes)

### Project Summary

The main objective of this project is a research paper which can be found [here](https://github.com/codyharris91/Pix2Vox-B657-Experiments/blob/master/paper.pdf).

During my computer vision course, I was introduced to various methods to reconstruct 3D objects with only 2D images. One of the best methods that has been created is a method called Pix2Vox. This is a deep learning based method that uses state of the art methods to reach some of the best accuracies in the computer vision field. 

I was the principal author and researcher of this paper in which I dove into experiments using these methods to try to understand the underlying deep learning network.

### What this work demonstates

I was able to take open source code and make small tweaks that made the code better serve my purposes. While my contributions to the code are small, I was able to understand complicated code for a deep learning project to the point of being able debug issues and create improvements. The paper shows my ability as an author to convey my findings in a conference paper style.

### Project Summary

Using weather data from NOAA and soil moisture data from a study performed at Cook Agronomy Farm to predict soil moisture from weather data using sci-kit learn. This project sought to eliminate complex formulas for evapotransporation or other water cycle phenomenom by creating a ML model that only incorporates some weather measurements. 

### What this work demonstrates

First, I was able to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. Although that alone consituted a great deal of work, the data cleaning and aggregation from various sources took the bulk of the effort in this project which is a skill that cannot be looked over for any data scientist.

## [Optical Musical Recognition](https://github.com/codyharris91/Optical-Music-Recognition) [<sup>1</sup>](#Footnotes)

### Project Summary

This team oriented project sought to identify quarter notes, quarter rests and eighth rests from an image of musical sheet music. The output is an image such as seen above along with a text document describing the identified objects, what they are, and their location. This program is meant to work no matter the size of the notes or rests inside the image and uses no libraries to automatically identify or classify the notes.

### What this work demonstrates

The main goal of this project was to combine various computer vision techniques, such as a hough transform, to complete a real project. Also this project was done with the effort of three individuals working seamlessly together using succinct conversation to accomplish this project in less than 7 days.

### Project Summary

A short and sweet project in which Human olfactory genes are compared to those of the genes found in a common housecat. This included using a combination of python and bash scripts to pull, compare, and clean data. The report explains my methods along with some preliminary findings.

### What this work demonstrates

This was a project from a bioinformatics data science course. I leveraged the unix shell and python to complete all data tasks on a virtual linux environment. Through this project I show my ability to interact with various APIs, and specifically the command line tools that are avaliable from NCBI. 

## [Bayes Net and Decision Tree from Scratch for Tweet Classification](https://github.com/codyharris91/Tweet-Classification)

### Project Summary

Given training data that includes a tweet and the location of a tweet, this project uses either a decision tree or a Bayes net to predict test tweets locations, solely based on the words or symbols within a tweet. 

### What this work demonstrates

This shows the ability to fully grasp the algorith and math behind a machine learning model and implement it from scratch with out using libraries such as sklearn. Only base libraries such as NumPy were used, and mostly for the ease and speed of mathimatical operations.

# Footnotes

**1** A project that I completed with a team. Unless otherwise noted, work was split as evenly as possible and was done collaboratively therefore it is nearly impossible to designate the specific work done by me.

**2** A project where other individuals contributed but I was the principal researcher, experimenter, implementer, coder, etc and teammates played a minor role.

Unless otherwise noted, all projects were completed individually by me. If a project was completed by a team, all team members are given credit for their contributions.
