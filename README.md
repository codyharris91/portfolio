### Project Summary

This project explores (somewhat silly) questions using R, plotting, and statistical inference. 

### What this work demonstrates

Through this work I am able to demonstrate my ability to not only accomplsh data analysis, but my ability to communicate my thought process and findings.

### Project Summary

The main objective of this project is a research paper which can be found [here](https://github.com/codyharris91/Pix2Vox-B657-Experiments/blob/master/paper.pdf).

During my computer vision course, I was introduced to various methods to reconstruct 3D objects with only 2D images. One of the best methods that has been created is a method called Pix2Vox. This is a deep learning based method that uses state of the art methods to reach some of the best accuracies in the computer vision field. 

I was the principal author and researcher of this paper in which I dove into experiments using these methods to try to understand the underlying deep learning network.

### What this work demonstates

I was able to take open source code and make small tweaks that made the code better serve my purposes. While my contributions to the code are small, I was able to understand complicated code for a deep learning project to the point of being able debug issues and create improvements. The paper shows my ability as an author to convey my findings in a conference paper style.
